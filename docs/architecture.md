## Principles

- **ChatGPT thinks. Codex works.** The bridge never re-implements a coding harness.
- **Computer Use = control plane**: tiny `[C2C]` state messages (< 1 KB).
- **MCP = data plane**: ChatGPT pulls files/diffs/search results itself.
- **Read-only by design**: no write/exec tools exist in V1 at all.
- **Explicit workspace selection**: legacy bridges serve one workspace. Opt-in
  shared bridges resolve each tool's `workspace_path` under both current policy
  and consented token roots. The token audience identifies the MCP endpoint.

## Components (src/)

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `bridge/` | Express app assembly, loopback-only listener, port fallback, runtime state, admin API |
| `mcp/` | McpServer with 9 read-only tools; stateless Streamable HTTP transport (fresh server per request, JSON responses) |
| `auth/` | OAuth 2.1 authorization server: discovery metadata (RFC 8414 + Protected Resource Metadata), dynamic client registration (RFC 7591), authorization-code + PKCE (S256 only), refresh rotation, revocation (RFC 7009). Opaque tokens stored as SHA-256 hashes |
| `pairing/` | PairingCode lifecycle: CSPRNG generation, TTL, attempt limits, IP rate limit, one-time use |
| `workspace/` | Canonical-path containment (realpath of deepest existing ancestor), sensitive-file policy, `.c2cignore`, paginated read/list, ripgrep search with Node fallback, git status/diff with pagination |
| `tunnel/` | `TunnelProvider` interface + Cloudflare Quick and workspace-configured Named Tunnel implementations; business logic is vendor-agnostic |
| `execution/` | JSONL execution records plus optional sanitized command output (`execution_output`) |
| `process/` | Daemon spawn/reuse, health probing, graceful shutdown |
| `cli/` | `c2c` commands; `--json` everywhere for the Skill |
| `config/`, `logger/` | OS-convention state dir, secret-redacting logger |

## Request lifecycles

**MCP call**: ChatGPT → tunnel (https) → bridge `/mcp` → bearer middleware
(401/403, audience) → stateless StreamableHTTP transport → per-call scope and
workspace resolver → optional workspace/run binding → workspace layer
(path containment → ignore rules → pagination) → JSON result.

**Authorization**: 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: resource_metadata=…` →
`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` → AS metadata → DCR →
`/oauth/authorize` (HTML pairing page) → pairing code verified → 302 with
authorization code → `/oauth/token` (PKCE S256) → access + refresh tokens.

**Ports**: prefer 48765, bind 127.0.0.1 only. On conflict, `/health` identifies
whether the occupant is a c2c bridge for the same workspace (reuse) or not
(fall back to an ephemeral port). Configuration follows automatically via the
runtime state file; users never see ports.

**Tunnel**: default is a Cloudflare Quick Tunnel (`cloudflared tunnel --url …`).
The URL changes per start, so `c2c doctor` can restart it and tell the Skill to
Delete + recreate that connection's ChatGPT connector. A workspace may instead
choose a named hostname once (`c2c tunnel choose --mode named`). The Skill asks
before the first public URL exists; `cloudflared tunnel login` is the only extra
user step. Tunnel name, hostname and preference live under the OS state dir
(`tunnels/<workspaceId>.json`), never in the project. Named starts use
`cloudflared tunnel --url … run <name>` so the public URL stays stable. If named
provisioning fails, C2C falls back to Quick Tunnel. If a named tunnel later
drops, doctor asks for a Cloudflare re-login (`namedRepair`) instead of
rotating the ChatGPT connector.

## Shared connection and isolated runs

`connection.json` enables a machine-wide `shared` connection identity. Runtime,
OAuth store, pairing, tunnel, logs, and endpoint preferences use that identity;
the selected workspace keeps its path-derived ID. Setup/doctor/start reuse the
same bridge from any approved folder. A local startup lock serializes concurrent
CLI callers; changes to roots require stopping the shared bridge.

`WorkspaceRouter` constructs a fresh `Workspace` for each tool invocation. It
canonicalizes roots and candidates, checks containment at path boundaries,
intersects server and token roots, and carries ancestor exclusion rules into
nested workspaces. There is no mutable current-workspace selector. All nine tool
results carry the actual workspace identity. Ordinary folders remain supported.

`runs/<runId>.json` binds one workspace to its own chat/Project/checkpoint and
optional Codex thread identity. Only pairing preferences carry over from
workspace sessions. Execution JSONL and output indexes are separately stored
per workspace/run, so two runs cannot overwrite each other's latest output.
The three execution tools require a run in shared mode and validate its binding.
Same-run concurrent writers remain the harness's responsibility.

See [setup and migration](shared-workspaces.md). Legacy state is retained;
`connection disable` restores the old lifecycle after the shared bridge stops.
